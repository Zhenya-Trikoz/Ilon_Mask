            <p class="text">SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk is one of the most fascinating people on the
                planet. A
                modern renaissance man, Musk’s tweets often generate a lot of speculation about future projects,
                or even
                just insights into the man himself. A new revelation? He likes baking.

                Elon Musk’s hobbies are no secret. From his unabashed love for HBO’s premium programming, to his
                video
                game habits which include games like Overwatch and No Man’s Sky, it’s clear that the man fills
                his time
                equally between his hobbies and his work. Sometimes, his hobbies become his work, like with the
                boom in
                Hyperloop technology. Now we might be getting a glimpse into his other domestic hobbies.

                Musk sent out a tweet this morning asking his 4.77 million followers whether or not he should
                bake,
                cookies that is.
                Turns out it was a rhetorical question, as there was never any doubt Musk wouldn’t be baking
                cookies on
                a Sunday
                morning.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="text">Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. His
                        mother is Maye Musk
                        (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, but raised in
                        South Africa. His father
                        is Errol Musk, a White South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and
                        property developer
                        who was once a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika. Musk has a
                        younger brother, Kimbal
                        (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974). His maternal grandfather, Joshua
                        Haldeman, was an
                        adventurous American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys in a
                        single-engine Bellanca
                        airplane to Africa and Australia; Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch
                        ancestry.<br></p>

                            width="25%">Aware that it would
                        be easier to enter the United States from Canada, Musk applied for a Canadian passport by
                        jus sanguinis, through his Canadian-born mother. While awaiting the documentation, he
                        attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service
                        in the South African military. Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, and lived with a second
                        cousin in Saskatchewan for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill. In 1990,
                        he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to
                        the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in
                        physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School.

                        In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage
                        startup Pinnacle Research
                        Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo
                        Alto-based startup Rocket
                        Science Games. In 1995, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in
                        materials science at Stanford
                        University in California. Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received a
                        response to his
                        inquiries. He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet
                        boom and launch an
                        Internet startup.</p>

                    <p class="text"><img src="img/mark.png" alt="" width="15%" class="left_img">In 1995, Musk, his
                        brother Kimbal, and
                        Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds borrowed from Musk's father. They
                        housed the venture
                        at a small rented office in Palo Alto. The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide
                        for the
                        newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages. Musk says that before
                        the company became
                        successful, he could not afford an apartment and instead rented an office and slept on the couch
                        and
                        showered at the
                        YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother.<br></p>
                    <p class="text">According to Musk, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it at
                        night,
                        seven days a
                        week, all the time." The Musk brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the
                        Chicago Tribune,
                        and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch. Musk's
                        attempts to become
                        CEO, a position held by its Chairman Rich Sorkin, were thwarted by the board. Compaq
                        acquired Zip2 for $307
                        million in cash in February 1999, and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent
                        share.<br></p>

                    <p class="text"><img src="img/PayPal.jpg" alt="" width="15%" class="left_img">In 1999, Musk
                        co-founded X.com, an
                        online financial services and e-mail payment company. The startup was one of the first federally
                        insured online
                        banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over 200,000 customers joined the service. The
                        company's
                        investors regarded Musk as inexperienced and had him replaced with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the
                        end
                        of the
                        year. The following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid
                        competition. Founded by
                        Max Levchin and Peter Thiel, Confinity had its own money-transfer service, PayPal, which was
                        more popular than
                        X.com's service.<br></p>
                    <p class="text">Within the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference for Microsoft
                        software over Unix
                        created a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign. Due to resulting technological issues
                        and lack of a
                        cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.
                        Under Thiel,
                        the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. In 2002 PayPal was
                        acquired by
                        eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.72% of
                        shares—received
                        $175.8
                        million. In 2017 Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount,
                        explaining it has
                        sentimental value.<br></p>

                    <p class="text"><img src="img/spaceX.png" alt="" width="15%" class="left_img">In 2001 Musk became
                        involved with the
                        nonprofit Mars Society. He was inspired by plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars
                        and
                        discussed funding
                        the project himself. In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Mike Griffin
                        to buy
                        refurbished Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads
                        into
                        space. He met
                        with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and was even spat
                        on
                        by one of the
                        Russian chief designers.<br></p>
                    <p class="text">The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the
                        group
                        returned to Russia
                        to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for
                        $8
                        million, which
                        Musk rejected. Musk instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets. With
                        $100 million of
                        his early fortune, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May
                        2002. As of
                        2021, he remains the company's CEO and also holds the title of Chief Engineer.<br><br></p>
